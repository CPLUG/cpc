/ Tyger, Tyger, burning bright            Where the hammer?  Where the chain?    \
| In the forests of the night,            In what furnace was thy brain?         |
| What immortal hand or eye               What the anvil?  What dread grasp      |
| Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?        Dare its deadly terrors clasp?         |
|                                                                                |
| Burnt in distant deeps or skies         When the stars threw down their spears |
| The cruel fire of thine eyes?           And water'd heaven with their tears    |
| On what wings dare he aspire?           Dare he laugh his work to see?         |
| What the hand dare seize the fire?      Dare he who made the lamb make thee?   |
|                                                                                |
| And what shoulder & what art            Tyger, Tyger, burning bright           |
| Could twist the sinews of they heart?   In the forests of the night,           |
| And when thy heart began to beat        What immortal hand or eye              |
| What dread hand & what dread feet       Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?       |
|                                                                                |
| Could fetch it from the furnace deep                                           |
| And in thy horrid ribs dare steep                                              |
| In the well of sanguine woe?                                                   |
| In what clay & in what mould                                                   |
| Were thy eyes of fury roll'd?                                                  |
\                 -- William Blake, "The Tyger"                                  /
