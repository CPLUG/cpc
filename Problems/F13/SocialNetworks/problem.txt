   You have a group of friends on Facebook. Some of these friends are friends
with each other, and some aren't.

   One day, you come across an old group of acounts on MySpace that you think
are the same group of friends. Unfortunately, everyone used a different alias
back then, and you can't figure out which (if any) of the accounts correspond
to which friend. However, you can see which accounts is friends with each
other.

   You know that everyone in this group is stubborn about their relationships.
If they are friends now then they would have been friends back then, and if
they aren't friends now then they wouldn't have been friends back then.

   Armed with just the knowledge of friendships between accounts, can you tell
if it's possible that this is the same group of friends?


                                  Input
   The first line of input will be N, the number friends in the group. The
next N lines will each contain a row in an friendship table. The i'th row and
j'th column in this table will be '1' if account i is friends with account j,
or '0' otherwise.

   The next N lines contain another friendship table, in the same format.


                                 Output
   The output will be 'Y' if it's possible for it to be the same group of
Friends, or 'N' otherwise.


                               Constraints
   1 <= N <= 20
   You can never be friends with yourself.
