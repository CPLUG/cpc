                                   Bash

   Once, after a long night of programming, I stumbled upon an interesting
command in bash. If you press alt+shift+[, you get output that looks something
like:

`.{bash{_{history,profile},rc},dmrc,htoprc,mybashrc,pinerc,screenrc,vimrc}`

   Try it! This output is related to how bash does tab completion for files.

   For this challenge, you are given a list of file names. Output what bash
would print if you pressed alt+shift+[ in a directory with those files in it.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will be N, the number files in the directory. The
next N lines will each contain a single file name. A file name may include
spaces.

                                 Output
   The output will be the output bash would give you if you pressed
alt+shift+[ in a directory with the files in it.


                               Constraints
   1 <= N <= 10^5
