   FizzBuzz is a common interview question to weed out bad programmers. You
can read more about it here:

   Not satisfied with this, Peter Faiman asks you to solve a more complicated
version of FizzBuzz. He calls it: BuzzFizz. (Originality isn't Peter's strong
suit.)

   If you make Peter happy, he'll give you a donut. You like donuts, right?

   First, you are given a number N to count up to, then a list of integer/word
pairs. Every time you reach a number that is a multiple of an integer in your
list, print out the corresponding word. If if it a multiple of multiple
integers, print out all the corresponding words, in order of the smallest
integer.

   If it isn't a multiple of any integer in your list, just print out the
number.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will be N, the number to count up to. The next
line will be K, the number of integers to check. The next K lines will each
have a positive integer, followed by a space, followed by an alphanumeric
string. 


                                 Output
   The output will contain N lines. Line numbering starts at 1. Each line will
either be the line number, or the words corresponding to the numbers that are
multiples of the line number.


                               Constraints
   1 < N <= 10^5
   1 <= integer in every pair <= N
   word in every pair will be alphanumeric (a-zA-Z0-9), no spaces
   every paired integer will be unique
