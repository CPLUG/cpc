                                AlarmClock
   Your friend has difficulties waking up in the morning, and so he wrote a
simple alarm clock program (in PHP, of course). The program works perfectly,
except for one design oversight: the wakeup time is too small to read, with
his poor vision.

   Unfortunately, your friend is a terribly shoddy programmer, and can't figure
out how to enlarge his output times. Upon hearing of his plight, you decide to
help out. Your friend says that he wants to transform the text to make it look
like a digital clock such that each number is 7 chars tall, and 7 chars wide.


                                  Input
   Input will consist of a single line, containing the time. The time will be
written in a 24-hour format, that is, without AM/PM designations. The time will
be written as 1 or 2 number digits, followed by a colon, followed by 2 number
digits.


                                 Output
   The output will be a 33x7 rectangle, representing the time given in the
input. Each number should be 7x7, with each number being padded by a column of
spaces. The 2nd and 3rd numbers will be seperated further by two '*' characters
on the 3rd and 5th rows, replacing the input time's colon. Trailing whitespace
will be ignored. See below for examples.


                               Constraints
   The time will be a valid 24-hour time. It will consist of a number in the
range 0 to 23 (inclusive), immediately followed by a colon, followed by a
number in the range 00 to 59 (inclusive). If the first number is between 0 and
9, it may or may not be proceeded by a 0 (08:00 and 8:00 are both valid).
