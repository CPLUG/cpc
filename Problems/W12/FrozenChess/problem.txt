                               FrozenChess                                  
   You are playing chess with a friend when a cold wind suddenly blows in and
freezes the chess board! Luckily, one of your pieces was untouched by the wind.
Now is your chance to strike! Unfortunately, all of your other pieces are
frozen, and you can't move through them (ie, standard chess rules still apply).

   Given the position of all your pieces, the position of all your opponent's
pieces, and the position and type of the unfrozen piece, determine if it's
possible to eliminate every single one of your opponent's pieces with just your
one unfrozen piece.

   Note that Pawns are too small weak to remain unfrozen.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will consist of two space-seperated integers, x and
y, the dimensions of the chess board. The next line will contain two integers,
a and b, followed by a single character, c. (a, b) is the position of the
unfrozen piece, and c will be either 'K', 'R', 'B', 'Q', 'i', representing the
type of the unfrozen piece (Knight, Rook, Bishop, Queen, and King,
respectively).

   The next line of input will contain one integer, K, the number of frozen
pieces that you have left on the board. The next K lines will contain two
integers, a_k and b_k, such that you have a frozen piece at (a_k, b_k).

   Lastly, the next line of input will contain one integer, J, the number of
frozen pieces your opponent has left on the board. The next J lines will
contain two integers, a_j and b_j, such that your opponent has a frozen piece
at (a_j, b_j).

   Note that all indicies are 1-index. Thus, the bottom-left corner of the
board is (1,1), and the top-right corner is (x,y).


                                 Output
   The output will single line: "Y" if every opponent piece on the board
can be captured by your one unfrozen piece, or "N" otherwise.
