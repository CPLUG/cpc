                                LuckyDay
   Your friend is an avid SuperLotto Plus player. Every week, he sits glued to
the TV screen as the winning numbers are called. Typically, he has terrible
luck, but his luck seems to be changing this week! You come over to visit him,
and find him sitting in front of his TV, eagerly awaiting the reveal of the 6 
winning lotto numbers. The numbers start to get revealed, one by one...

   The first number is a match.

   The second number... is a match too.

   The third and fourth numbers are both matches!

   Unbelievable! The fifth number is also a match!!!

   Your friend sits and stares in disbelief. Could he really be the next
multimillionaire?

   "The sixth, and final number is..."

   Suddenly, the power in your friend's apartment surges, causing sparks to fly
and the TV to shut off. Your friend, desperate to know his fate, begs you to
figure out what that last number was.

   Luckily for him, you happen to know the exact algorithm that SuperLotto uses
to produce the winning numbers. The algorithm starts with three integers, A, B,
and the seed (also known as Q_0). Once we know Q_n, we can find Q_(n+1) by:

   Q_(n+1) = (A * Q_n + B) % 256

   Given the list of lotto numbers already called, determine the next number in
the sequence, Q_6. Hurry, your friend's life may hang in the balance!


                                  Input
   Input will consist of a single line containing 5 space-seperated integers,
representing the first 5 lotto numbers (Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4, and Q_5),
respectively.


                                 Output
   The output will be a single integer, the final lottery number, Q_6.


                               Constraints
