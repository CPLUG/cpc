   Trainyard is a puzzling game. You must place tracks in order to guide a
train to an exit. Unfortunately, the game runs very slowly on your (old,
antiquated) phone.

   Tired of waiting on your phone to see if you completed the problem
successfully, you decide to simulate the game on your computer, which is much
faster than your phone.

   Given a track configuration, output whether or not the train can
successfully reach an exit.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will contain two integers, H and W. The next H
lines will contain W characters.

   A ' ' character means that no track is in this square. A train cannot be on
a square without any track.

   A '|' character means that a vertical track is in this square. A train can
only enter and exit up and down on a vertical track.

   A '-' character means that a horizontal track is in this square. A train can
only enter and exit left and right on a horizontal track.

   A '+' character means that a horizontal and vertical track cross on this
square. A train can continue forward on a track cross, but cannot change
direction.

   A '*' character means that a roundabout is in this square. A train can
enter and leave a roundabout in any direction.

   A 'S' character means that the train starts in this square. There will be
one starting location in every input.

   A 'E' character means that the train can exit in this square. A train can
enter this square from any direction.

   Note that a roundabout is the only way to change direction. See Input 2 for
a demonstration of this behavior.


                                 Output
   The output will be a line containing the string "I win!" if the train can
successfully reach an exit, or a line containing the string "I lose..."
otherwise.


                               Constraints
   0 < H < 16
   0 < W < 16

   There will only one starting location per input.
   
   There may be multiple exits per input, but there will always be at least
one.

   No exit will be adjacent to the starting location.
