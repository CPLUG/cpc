   War is an incredibly complex 2-player card game. You start out with a
standard deck of 52 cards, and then distribute the cards into two stacks.

   Play then begins with each player flipping the card from the top of their
deck. The player that flips the higher card wins the round. If both players
flip cards of the same value (suits are irrelevant), then both players flip
four more cards. The player with the higher fourth card wins the round (the
other three flipped cards are ignored). If this results in another tie, the
process is repeated until either there is no tie, or one player is out of
cards.

   At the end of every round, the round's winner takes the cards in play and
places them on the bottom of their stack in the order in which they were
flipped, with their card before their opponent's.

   To illustrate this, let's walk through an example round. The round starts,
and both you and your opponent flip over a card to put it in play. You flip
over a 2 of Hearts, and your opponent flips over a 2 of Spades:

   My Cards    |   His Cards
            2H | 2S            

   Since this is a tie, both players flip over four more cards. You flip over a
Ace of Hearts, a King of Clubs, a Queen of Spades, and a 3 of Spades, in that
order. Your opponent flips over a 3 of Clubs, a 4 of Hearts, a 5 of Hearts, and
an Ace of Spades.

   My Cards    |   His Cards
3S QS KC AH 2H | 2S 3C 4H 5H AS

   Since your opponent's Ace of Spades has a higher value than your 3 of
Spades, your opponent wins this round. Your opponent then appends cards to
their stack in the following order: 2S, 2H, 3C, AH, 4H, KC, 5H, QS, AS, 3S.
Thus, 3S will be at the bottom of your opponent's stack.

   Aces are the highest card in the deck, and 2's are the lowest.

   Gameplay ends when a player needs to flip a card, but has no cards in their
stack. Note that this means that it is possible to not have any cards in your
stack and still be in the game. The winner is the player with cards remaining.

   Given the starting deck for both players, who wins?
