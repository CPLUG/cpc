                               GameOfFlags
   Flags is a breezy game. There are N flags in the middle of a playing field,
then you choose a set of K numbers, a_1, a_2, ..., a_K.

   You then take turns removing a_i flags from the middle of the field. The
last player to remove a flag wins.

   You get to take your turn first. Can you force a win?


                                  Input
   The first line of input will contain two integers, N and K. The next line
will contain K integers, representing a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, respectively.


                                 Output
   The output will be a line containing the string "I win!" if you can force a
win over your opponent, or a line containing the string "I lose..." otherwise.


                               Constraints
   0 < N < 20000000
   0 < K < 6
   0 < a_i < 100
