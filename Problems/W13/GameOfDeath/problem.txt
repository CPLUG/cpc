                               GameOfDeath
   Conway's Game of Life is a morbid game. At least, it is when you take away
the repopulation rule. Being the optimist that you are, you try to remember
back to better days. Unfortunately, your memory is failing you, and you don't
remember exactly how you got to your current state.

   The game board is a H-by-W finite square grid. Each cell in the grid is
either "alive" (indicated by a '*') or "dead" (indicated by a ' ').

   Given a game board, the rules for generating the next board are:

      1) If an "alive" cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, then it remains alive.
      2) Any other cell is "dead".

   Given a game board, must print out a game board of the same size that
generates the given board.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will contain two integers: H and W. The next H
lines will contain W characters. If cell is "alive", it will be represented by
a '*', and it will be represented by ' ' if it is dead.


                                 Output
   The output will be H lines, each containing W characters. Every cell must 
either be '*' for "alive" or ' ' for "dead". The game board that this
represents must generate the input game board.

   Note that you must output whitespace for *all* dead cells.

   Note that there are multiple correct answers for this problem.


                               Constraints
   0 < H < 16
   0 < W < 16
   Each game board is guaranteed to have a generating state.
