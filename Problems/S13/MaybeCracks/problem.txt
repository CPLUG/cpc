   Over many years of walking home, you have developed a "game" based on the
sidewalks you walk on. You try to take the same number of steps on a section of
sidewalk as you did on the one previous, plus or minus one. Thus, you could
take 1, 2, 2, 3, and 2 steps on consecutive sections of sidewalk, but you could
not take 1, 3, and 2 steps.

   You may take any number of steps you want in the first section.

   However, since some of the sidewalks you walk on are rather unkept,
there are cracks forming in some sections of sidewalk. This excites you: each
one of these aging cracks means you get to choose whether it divides a section
into smaller subsections or not!

   Given a sidewalk configuration, determine if it's possible to (dis)regard a
set of cracks and walk across the entire sidewalk without losing your game.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will contain one integer, N, the number of segments
of sidewalk to walk across. On the next line will be N integers, a[i],
signifying the number of steps required to cross a section of sidewalk. The
integers will be seperated by either " | " (signifying a full crack) or " : "
(signifying a maybe crack).


                                 Output
   The output will be a line containing the string "Yes" if the entire sidewalk
can be traversed, or a line containing the string "No" otherwise.


                               Constraints
   1 < N < 10^6
   0 < a[i] < 10^4
