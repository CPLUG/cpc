   Your friend is fascinated by magic squares, which are a N by N array of
numbers whose columns and rows all add up to the same number (diagonals are
irrelevant).

   Your friend particularly enjoys trying to come up with new magic squares.
Unfortunately, your friend is bad at math, and has difficulties checking if
the numbers he comes up actually form a magic square. Being the good friend
that you are, you decide to write a program that does this for him.

   Given an array of numbers, output whether or not the square provided forms
a magic square.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will contain one integer, N, the number of rows and
columns in the magic square. The next N lines will each contain N integers,
a[i][j].


                                 Output
   The output will be a line containing the string "Yes" if the provided
numbers form a magic square, or a line containing the string "No" otherwise.


                               Constraints
   2 < N < 40
   -10^7 < a[i][j] < 10^7
