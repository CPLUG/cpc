                                FlowFill
                                20 points
   Flow can be a frustrating game. It's played on a 2-D grid by connecting
one point on the grid to its matching point elsewhere. Your lines must fill up
the entire grid in order to beat the level.

   You are down to the last two points, and are trying to figure out if it's
possible to have a single line that connects these two, while filling up the
rest of the grid.

   Given a grid and two matching points, output whether or not you can draw a
single line that fills all the empty grid squares.


                                  Input
   The first line of input will contain two integers, H and W, the number of
rows and columns in the grid, respectively. The next H lines will contain W
characters.

   A '*' character signals one of the two points that need to be connected.
There will always be two.

   A 'x' character indicates a square that has already been filled.

   A '.' character indicates a square that has not yet been filled.

                                 Output
   The output will be a line containing the string "Yes" if you can fill the
entire grid with a single line connecting the two points, or a line containing
the string "No" otherwise.


                               Constraints
   2 < H < 10
   2 < W < 10
